REM ******** Explanation *******

REM ping -n 600 127.0.0.1 > /null
REM     This is a trick to force the script to "wait" for 600 .
REM     each ping will take 1s, so ping-ing to local 600 times will take 600 seconds
REM     The redirection '> /null' is to avoid the command screen from being flooded with ping outputs

REM & : to indicate the next command 'shutdown' will be executed only after 'ping' completes

REM shutdown : /s option is to shutdown
REM            /t option is to indicate the delay . The script delay shutdown by 600 seconds
REM            Note, /t only accepts value upto 600 seconds.
